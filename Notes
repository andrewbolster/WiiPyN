Several parts to this problem that should be kept separate as far as possible, potentially separate files.

*Dealing with the bluetooth connection to the wiimote/device, as well as whatever noise cancellation/motion dampening stuff is necessary

*Render Motions and position wrt a object in nD space
(wiimote has 3D positioning, nunchuck also has 3D, so even without using buttons, thats 6D navigation. Altho i know it'll take shit tonnes of practice (especially using 3d goggles) to become familiar with it.)
